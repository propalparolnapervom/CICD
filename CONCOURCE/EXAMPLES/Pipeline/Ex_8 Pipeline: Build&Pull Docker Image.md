# EXAMPLE 7 PIPELINE: Build&Pull Docker Image



Create pipeline:
  - there's a `git` repo with Dockerfile
  - Create a Pipeline to:
    - checkout that `git` repo
    - build Docker image
    - pull just built Docker image to Docker Hub


# RUN

Create a Task File `pipeline.yml`
```
---
jobs:
- name: xbs_local_job
  public: true
  plan:
    - get: xbs_source_resource
    - put: xbs_destination_resource
      params:
        build: xbs_source_resource
            
resources:
- name: xbs_source_resource
  type: git
  source:
    uri: https://github.com/xbu/test.git
    branch: master

- name: xbs_destination_resource
  type: docker-image
  source:
    email: se@ukr.net
    username: xbu
    password: xbu
    repository: xbu/autogenerated
```


> Note: To push created Docker image to Docker Hub namespace has to be used, the same one as Docker Hub user name.

> For example, here `xbu/autogenerated` was used instead of just `autogenerated`




# SET PIPELINE

Set up Pipeline from just created Task File.
```
fly -t tutorial sp -c pipeline.yml -p devops311-local
```

Unpause Pipeline (if needed)
```
fly -t tutorial up -p devops311-local
```
